      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I will create my website to show others how I can improve myself helping people.</p>
      <P>Because I intend to set up an Foundation to help people.</P>
      <p>in the webpage I will put my ideas and in the way I will help people.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>However, this website might have the pictures of what I am doing, what I have been done, and what I am working on.</p>
      <p>To do, I will choose others to helping me growing the Foundation.
        •	What impression you have on my idea?
        •	What do you think I can do better to create the Foundation? 
        <p>First, I can present myself, 
          Daniel Alfred 
          I am a positive person, I believe in what I am doing will work even I failed I consider my failure as a lesson,
          I learn from it and continue to progress and sometimes look where I failed and try not to fail on again. 
          I like helping others, I believe in helping people because in some occasion I have learned things from them.
          My weakness is “scared” I always scared to do somethings, but when I star doing it it’s work all my fears are gone.
          The big gift that I give myself is return back on my education. Since I joined Pathway,
          I gained a lot to my knowledge that gives me a big dream to continue working hard get my degree.
          I believe that I will do it because it will be a benefit for me and my family. 
          I the past I plan to work in Law Enforcement, I started in Criminal Justice I change my mind and thinking about another career,
          and said the way the world going now let me choose the technology, in the technology have a security system on also, 
          I will learn and keep going. I love going out with my family get some great time to the movie or restaurant and some other places.
          I despise when people talking bad about me. Criticism makes me learn and progress,
          but I despise one whom doing negative criticism about me. Since I have 10 years old my mom dies and I am struggle to do things on my own,
          I will continue to work hard, and I am positive I will accomplish my dream. It’s not a dream to take care myself, 
          but it’s a dream to help others in my community and my country for those that I know who are suffering.
          Education and action can make things going well.
          
        <p>I shared Importance of the foundation with a group of return missionaries who as serve mission in Haiti,
           because we have project to create an organization to go to Haiti to help some of the returning missionaries who cannot afford the prices to go to school.
          I propose some of the missionaries who live in UAS and some other countries in the world they were happy,
          and we accept now to create the foundation, it was a great moment for me while I am taking this class to use my knowledge in technology to help,
          we already in the process now to legalize the organization that I know it will be a blessing for the returning missionaries,
          especially those in needs. The tool that I find great to get help is to create a website that I can use as a great tool to help others,
          I know now find a better job ask to have good knowledge especially in networking, I will use the knowledge of networking tool to help some returning missionaries,
          the better way to look for job. I think BYUI Connect will be a great toll for me to help others who as a job seeker. Give back what l have been learning will be a great opportunity for me as a person who like helping others, 
          as I prepare to teach others to learn careers, and while they are at school to use networking to create contact that can help to find a job quickly after they finish school.
          Because a lot of people think that when they finish learning at school, they may start looking for a job, but networking makes me think differently now.
