                I am a positive person, I believe in what I am doing will work even I failed I consider my failure as a lesson,
          I learn from it and continue to progress and sometimes look where I failed and try not to fail on again. 
          I like helping others, I believe in helping people because in some occasion I have learned things from them.
          My weakness is “scared” I always scared to do somethings, but when I star doing it it’s work all my fears are gone.
          The big gift that I give myself is return back on my education. Since I joined Pathway,
          I gained a lot to my knowledge that gives me a big dream to continue working hard get my degree.
