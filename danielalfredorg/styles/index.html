                We believe that there is nothing like sewing for expressing yourself. That is why we subscribe to the
                handcraft philosophy of sewing and handcrafting—keep sewing for memories of grandma, family, and friends
                or bring together magnificent colors, fonts, and handmade items for decor of inviting country
                home.<br />
                That doesn't mean we don't also like contemporary or modern home styles. Opposites in all things, after
                all. We believe that all homes should represent those who abide there and accentuate their
                personalities.<br />
                We invite you to come to browse our items or bring your ideas to life with custom-made products. Check
                out our current, past, and custom projects. We're waiting to hear from you!
